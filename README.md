# Media-Spam
A personal script I created just to see if I could do it.

This script has no console window and will open a configurable list of URL's and media files (.mp4, .mp3, .jpg, .png) continuously with no easy way to stop the process other than logging out or shutting down the computer.

Features:
- Configure URL's to open in memes.txt
- Configure media to open by simply placing it in the current-working-directory of the script
- No Console Window!
- Confirmations through popups
- Cleanup Script (reset.pyw) [Removes media folder in user-home]

*If you are planning to use a python install from the USB, please create a shortcut to run the script using Python on the USB
